# Cross-Covariate Gait Recognition: A Benchmark

Welcome to the official repository for the paper "Cross-Covariate Gait Recognition: A Benchmark," which has been accepted to AAAI 2024. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset and approach to gait recognition under various covariate conditions. Below you'll find details about the paper, dataset, and accompanying resources.
