# Cross-Covariate Gait Recognition: A Benchmark

Welcome to the official repository for the paper "Cross-Covariate Gait Recognition: A Benchmark," which has been accepted to AAAI 2024. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset and approach to gait recognition under various covariate conditions. Below you'll find details about the paper, dataset, and accompanying resources.

## Dataset Visualization
Here are some visualizations that depict the characteristics of the Cross-Covariate Gait Recognition (CCGR) dataset in comparison with other existing datasets, as well as the distribution of covariates, viewpoints, and data modalities within CCGR.

## Modalities in the CCGR Dataset
We are one of the earliest teams to explore parsing-based gait recognition, and our work on parsing had been previously submitted to CVPR 2023.

## Dataset Download Links
If you are interested in using the derived data from the CCGR dataset, such as parsing, silhouettes, and poses, please ensure that you agree to and comply with the following conditions:

1. The data may only be used for research purposes.
2. If you share the dataset with other researchers, you must convey the first condition regarding its use explicitly.

If you agree to the above terms, there is no need to send us any special download request! You can directly access the data via the links provided below:

- **Google Drive**: [Download Dataset (Google)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/XXXX)

We encourage open and responsible use of the dataset for research, and we appreciate your cooperation and understanding.

## Pre-trained Models
We provide partial weights of our models trained under the same conditions. Due to the nature of deep learning, performance can fluctuate by 1%-2% per run.
